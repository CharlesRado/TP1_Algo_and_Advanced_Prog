In this lab we will see three parts : 

Part 1 : Factorial Solutions 
Part 2 : Fibonacci Solutions 
Part 3 : String Reversal 

In these parts, I will answer to several questions to find out more about the different aspects of these topics.

Part 1 : Factorial Solutions 

Write a method called factorial(n), which given a integer n, it computes the value of n!

1. Write a recursive solution
2. Implement an iterative solution via letter swapping
3. Compare the efficiency of both solutions and plot the complexity of both solutions.

Part 2 : Fibonacci Solutions

Write an algorithm that for a given integer n output its Fibonacci sequence
Fibonacci sequence is defined as follow :

𝐹0 = 0 𝐹1 = 1 𝐹(𝑛+2) = 𝐹(𝑛+1) + 𝐹𝑛
Examples :
          - F(5) = 5
          - F(8) = 21

1. Create a method called RecursiveFib(n), which given a number n, computes and
returns it’s Fibonacci sequence using a recursive algorithm

2. Create a method called IterativeFib(n), which given a number n, computes and
returns it’s Fibonacci sequence using an iterative algorithm

3. What is the theoretical complexity for computing Fibonacci

4. For values from 1 to 100, compute the duration taken to compute the Fibonacci
value for both values. Plot these values, do both curves respect the theoretical
complexity ?

Part 3 : String Reversal 

Write a method called reverse(s), which given a string S, it reverses the string and returns
the value. For example: reverse(‘abc’) returns ‘cba’.

1. Write a recursive solution

2. Implement an iterative solution via letter swapping

3. Compare the efficiency of both solutions and plot the complexity of both solutions,
you should consider temporal.
